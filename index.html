    <h2>The Main Story</h2>
    <p>Long before the videos on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvZOsr6bb-vr5oVzQMqsGUA">DHMK Youtube channel</a>, our heroes and villians were much different. The Goofy Ball Stealer was a small child, The Straightinator was still your average Gym Kingdom castle guard, and it was overall happier times. But when the King left on a journey to find the lost queen, his son caused unfixable damages.</p>

    <h2>IRL DHMK</h2>
    <p>Irl DHMK was how this whole idea sparked in the first place, however the future for it looks dim. This year we have different classes (which we did before, but maybe, just maybe, some people skipped for 2 weeks straight) and ngl its a little bit embarrassing recording yourself on a 3ds in 2022. If we do more irl DHMK, we will definitely let you know.</p>

    <h2>Basic Info</h2>
    <p>
      DHMK was originally just a group of friends who were just having fun, making a joke in Gym class. Then over the summer we had a group chat where we still would like to do sometihing with the channel. Thats when we decided to Make a Web-Comic. This Web-Comic takes place before the videos and has actual lore and is currently being worked on.
